## 🐛 Bug Fixes

## 💥 Breaking Changes

### Spark Livy Client Changes

- **Async Session Creation**: `createSession` method in SparkLivyClient is now an async operation
- **Migration Required**: Update existing code that uses `createSession` to handle async operation
- **Impact**: Code using SparkLivyClient will need to be updated to use await/Promise syntax

```javascript
// Old synchronous approach
const session = livyClient.createSession(config);

// New async approach
const session = await livyClient.createSession(config);
```

### API Signature Updates

- **List API Changes**: Some list API signatures have been updated to match current Fabric platform implementations
- **Batch to Async**: Batch operations have been converted to async result patterns
- **Migration**: Review and update code using batch operations to use new async patterns

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### Spark Livy Client Updates

```javascript
// Update createSession calls to async
// Before:
const session = sparkLivyClient.createSession(sessionConfig);

// After:
const session = await sparkLivyClient.createSession(sessionConfig);
```

## 📋 Upgrade Instructions

1. **Update SparkLivy Client Usage** ⚠️ **Required for Breaking Changes**
   - Update all `createSession` calls to use async/await syntax
   - Test Spark session management functionality
   - Verify session lifecycle operations work correctly

2. **Configure Environment Suffix** ⭐ **Recommended**
   - Add `ENVIRONMENT_DISPLAY_NAME_SUFFIX` to your `.env` files
   - Set appropriate values for different environments (dev, test, prod)
   - Redeploy to apply environment suffix changes

3. **Update Memory Configuration** ⭐ **Recommended**
   - Add `ENABLE_MEMORY_MONITORING` environment variable to your `.env` files (set to `false` for production, `true` for development if needed)
   - Review development server memory settings
   - Update webpack configuration if experiencing memory issues
   - Test development build performance

4. **Adopt New Dialog Control** ⭐ **Recommended**
   - Replace custom dialog implementations with new DialogControl component
   - Update styling to use CSS variables for theming
   - Test dialog functionality across different scenarios
